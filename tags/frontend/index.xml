As we presented in the previous article, we have showed how to implement the FolderFlip with limited number (like 3) items with the position: sticky and IntersectionObserver.
The Problem But it only allows limited number, if it comes more items or the screen is smaller, the items would not be able to scroll. So how would we display if the items are more and the titles take most of the screen.</description></item><item><title>How to implement a FolderFlip with React</title><link>https://xfsnowind.github.io/blogs/folderflip/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 11:15:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://xfsnowind.github.io/blogs/folderflip/</guid><description>
Haven't updated the blogs for a long time. Just had been struggling on the house work during the whole summer time, painting external and internal wall, new bathroom and etc. But there is still the good news, implemented an interesting frontend component with React, which would inspired by lifeatspotify - borrow the name FolderFlip.
The original idea was come up with by the UX designer in our team, she would like to develop a fancy component which can be used to present the company culture.</description></item></channel></rss>
