This article is a summary when I learned the React Hooks course in GeekTime. Even though we all use React Hooks in the frontend development, I cannot say I understand the internal core and logic of it. So this is a good time to re-learn it through this course. According to my experience, it's definitely better to write down the idea and thoughts down -- The palest ink is better than the best memory.</description></item><item><title>Promise</title><link>https://xfsnowind.github.io/blogs/promise/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 22:30:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xfsnowind.github.io/blogs/promise/</guid><description>
Promise is a general concept to handle the asynchronize development in javascript. It's not hard to use, but when it comes with some other concepts, like react's hook, its internal chain etc. It always takes me some time to think through it. Especially when check the code of some open-source libraries, find the way they use Promise is quite fancy and also hard to understand, which reminders me that I am still stay on the level of using, far away from deep understanding.</description></item></channel></rss>
