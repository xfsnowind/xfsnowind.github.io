Haven't updated the blogs for a long time. Just had been struggling on the house work during the whole summer time, painting external and internal wall, new bathroom and etc. But there is still the good news, implemented an interesting frontend component with React, which would inspired by lifeatspotify - borrow the name FolderFlip.
The original idea was come up with by the UX designer in our team, she would like to develop a fancy component which can be used to present the company culture.</description></item></channel></rss>
