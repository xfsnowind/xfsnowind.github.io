The first time I touched the React-hook-form was in 2020 and it also was the first time I learned React's new concept Hooks. During that time we compared all the popular form libraries, Formik, react-form, final form and etc, but we finally chose the React-hook-form even though it was still under the development during that time. It is because it uses React latest concept Hooks. And React was our fundamental framework in my previous company, so we didn't need to think about the compatibility.</description></item></channel></rss>
